<h1>Places to Visit</h1>
<div id="visit">
<p>If you’re looking for family fun, adrenaline-fuelled adventure, a skiing break, or romance and relaxation, 
Queenstown has the ideal mix of activities and attractions to keep you entertained on your visit. World-renowned 
for its adventure, Queenstown is home to a huge choice of adrenaline based activities including jetboating, 
bungy jumping, white water rafting and skydiving – all guaranteed to get your blood pumping! The region also has 
a world-class ski and snowboard season from June to October. If you’re looking for a slightly slower pace there’s 
plenty of hiking and biking trails, guided tours, boat cruises, scenic flights or spa and wellness centres.

<h2>1- Lake Wakatipu:</h2>
<figure><img src="images/places/lake-wakatipu.jpg" width="600" height="250" alt>Lake Wakatipu</figure>
<p>Dazzling Lake Wakatipu is New Zealand's longest lake. Shaped like an inverted "n" it is a highlight of a trip to 
Queenstown, which nestles against a curve near the middle of the lake. During the last ice age, a huge glacier carved 
out the lake, which sinks to a depth of 1,300 feet (400 meters).The surrounding mountains provide a dramatic backdrop 
to the crystal waters, all of which was featured as the location for the Lothlorein scenes in The Lord of the Rings.

<p>Milford attracts between 550,000 and 1 million visitors per year. This makes the sound one of New Zealand's most-visited

Milford Sound Visitors Centre.
