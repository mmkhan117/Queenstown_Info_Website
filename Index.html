<h2>Queenstown:</h2>
<p>Queenstown (Māori: Tāhuna) is a resort town in Otago in the south-west of New Zealand's South Island.
285 km north-west of Dunedin and 187 km north of Invercargill, and had a 2013 population of 11,505.

Queenstown sits halfway along Lake Wakatipu, It is built around an inlet called Queenstown Bay on Lake Wakatipu, 
a long thin Z-shaped lake formed by glacial processes, and has spectacular views of nearby mountains such as The Remarkables, 
Cecil Peak, Walter Peak and just above the town; Ben Lomond and Queenstown Hill.

Queenstown’s dramatic setting, surrounded by mountains on the edge of glacial Lake Wakatipu, is unequalled – particularly in autumn, when the deciduous trees are colourful.
William Rees had run sheep in the area for just two years when gold was discovered on the Shotover River in November 1862. A town sprang to life; the site of Rees’s old homestead, 
the Camp, is in the centre of Queenstown. After gold fever waned, the town declined.<figure><img src="images/home/shotover_river.jpg" width="600" height="250" alt>Shotover River</figure> 
Through the first half of the 20th century it had fewer than 1,000 people, with a trickle of summer holidaymakers. In 1981 Queenstown’s resident population was still less than 3,500. 
Since then, tourist numbers increased rapidly – in winter as well as summer. In 2007 Queenstown attracted about 1 million visitors staying at least one night; about half were domestic 
tourists and half were international.</p><br />

<h2>Tourism:</h2>
<p>A resort town, Queenstown boasted 220 adventure tourism activities in 2012. Skiing and snowboarding, jet boating, whitewater rafting, bungy jumping, mountain biking,
 skateboarding, tramping, paragliding, sky diving and fly fishing are all popular.<figure><img src="images/home/walking.jpg" width="600" height="250" alt></figure> 
 Queenstown is a major centre for snow sports in New Zealand, with people from all over the country and many parts of the world travelling to ski at the four main mountain ski fields 
 "Cardrona Alpine Resort, Coronet Peak, The Remarkables and Treble Cone".<figure><img src="images/home/Skippers_Canyon_Jet.jpg" width="600" height="250" alt></figure> Cross country skiing 
 is also available at the Waiorau Snowfarm, near Cardrona village. The 100-year-old twin screw coal fired steamer TSS Earnslaw traverses Lake Wakatipu.
Queenstown lies close to the centre of a small wine producing region, reputed to be the world's southernmost. The Two Paddocks vineyard is owned by local actor Sam Neill. 
<figure><img src="images/home/ski.jpg" width="600" height="250" alt></figure>Neighbouring, historic Arrowtown features restaurants and bars. Queenstown has many festivals, In 2013, 
examples include Bike Festival (March/April), Winter Festival (June) and Jazz Festival (October). And many more activities keep going each year which make Queesntown a very busy Town.
